    # Task 9.6 of solid-node's whole-tree-fixpoint cycle (ADR-099) asked
    # for exactly this sentence and this project's own
    # restate-reducer-chain-per-adr-099 change tried and reverted it: on a
    # freshly built instance it resolved correctly (`reducer.planet_1.orbit`
    # starts unbound, so the pass defers it, per ADR-099's own contract),
    # but on every SUBSEQUENT `set_state` against the SAME instance
    # `attempt(Root)` read a STALE value left over from the previous pass,
    # because `PlanetaryReducer` (the assembly whose phase clears and
    # recomputes that coordinate) had not run yet this pass -- measured at
    # maximum deviation 4.320e+02 over the project's 7 poses. That was a
    # framework defect, not a project limit: fixed upstream by
    # solid-node's deferred-read-is-current change (archived
    # solid-node/openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-11-deferred-read-is-current/),
    # which has `ResolvedEnd.bound()` recognize a value bound by the
    # attempting assembly or one of its own descendants during a PREVIOUS
    # pass as unready, so this attempt defers to the tree-wide fixpoint
    # instead of reading it early. Restated here now that the fix is
    # current; see this change's own repose probe.
