    # Task 9.6 of solid-node's whole-tree-fixpoint cycle (ADR-099) asked
    # this line to be restated as `reducer.planet_1.orbit.drives(
    # output_stack.planet_carrier_b.turn)`, sourcing the carrier motion
    # from the coordinate the reducer's OWN relations already compute,
    # so CARRIER_RATIO is written once instead of twice. Tried and
    # reverted (evidence: openspec/changes/restate-reducer-chain-per-adr-099/
    # proposal.md): on a freshly built instance the sentence resolves
    # correctly, because `reducer.planet_1.orbit` starts unbound and the
    # pass defers it properly (ADR-099's own contract). On every
    # SUBSEQUENT `set_state` against the SAME instance it reads a STALE
    # value instead: `attempt(Root)` (root's own relations, resolved
    # before any child's phase runs) finds `reducer.planet_1.orbit`
    # already non-None -- the value it was left holding at the end of
    # the PREVIOUS pass, because `PlanetaryReducer` (the assembly whose
    # phase would clear and recompute it this pass) has not run yet --
    # and binds `output_stack.planet_carrier_b.turn` from it immediately
    # instead of deferring to the tree-wide fixpoint that would see the
    # fresh number. Measured directly against `capture_poses.py`'s own
    # repeated-pose sequence on one instance: maximum deviation 4.320e+02
    # over the project's 7 poses (`output_stack.*` bodies land on the
    # PREVIOUS pose's carrier angle, not the current one). The ratio is
    # therefore still stated twice, once here and once in the reducer,
    # both reading `CARRIER_RATIO` from `layout.py` so the two numbers
    # cannot drift, exactly as `move-onto-motion`'s Known gaps left it.
